    "\n",
    "* The `compute_loss` function takes in a mini-batch of experience tuples. This mini-batch of experience tuples is unpacked to extract the `states`, `actions`, `rewards`, `next_states`, and `done_vals`. You should keep in mind that these variables are *TensorFlow Tensors* whose size will depend on the mini-batch size. For example, if the mini-batch size is `64` then both `rewards` and `done_vals` will be TensorFlow Tensors with `64` elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using `if/else` statements to set the $y$ targets will not work when the variables are tensors with many elements. However, notice that you can use the `done_vals` to implement the above in a single line of code. To do this, recall that the `done` variable is a Boolean variable that takes the value `True` when an episode terminates at step $j+1$ and it is `False` otherwise. Taking into account that a Boolean value of `True` has the numerical value of `1` and a Boolean value of `False` has the numerical value of `0`, you can use the factor `(1 - done_vals)` to implement the above in a single line of code. Here's a hint: notice that `(1 - done_vals)` has a value of `0` when `done_vals` is `True` and a value of `1` when `done_vals` is `False`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, compute the loss by calculating the Mean-Squared Error (`MSE`) between the `y_targets` and the `q_values`. To calculate the mean-squared error you should use the already imported package `MSE`:\n",

Our agent starts out using a value of $\\epsilon =$ `epsilon = 1` which yields an $\\epsilon$-greedy policy that is equivalent to the equiprobable random policy. This means that at the beginning of our training, the agent is just going to take random actions regardless of the observed `state`. As training progresses we will decrease the value of $\\epsilon$ slowly towards a minimum value using a given $\\epsilon$-decay rate. We want this minimum value to be close to zero because a value of $\\epsilon = 0$ will yield an $\\epsilon$-greedy policy that is equivalent to the greedy policy. This means that towards the end of training, the agent will lean towards selecting the `action` that it believes (based on its past experiences) will maximize $Q(s,a)$. We will set the minimum $\\epsilon$ value to be `0.01` and not exactly 0 because we always want to keep a little bit of exploration during training. If you want to know how this is implemented in code we encourage you to take a look at the `utils.get_action` function in the `utils` module.\n",

This function checks if $C =$ `NUM_STEPS_FOR_UPDATE = 4` time steps have occured and if our `memory_buffer` has enough experience tuples to fill a mini-batch. For example, if the mini-batch size is `64`, then our `memory_buffer` should have at least `64` experience tuples in order to pass the latter condition. If the conditions are met, then the `utils.check_update_conditions` function will return a value of `True`, otherwise it will return a value of `False`.\n",

The learning update consists of sampling a random mini-batch of experience tuples from our `memory_buffer`, setting the $y$ targets, performing gradient descent, and updating the weights of the networks. We will use the `agent_learn` function we defined in [Section 8](#8) to perform the latter 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Line 15**: At the end of each iteration of the inner loop we set `next_state` as our new `state` so that the loop can start again from this new state.
