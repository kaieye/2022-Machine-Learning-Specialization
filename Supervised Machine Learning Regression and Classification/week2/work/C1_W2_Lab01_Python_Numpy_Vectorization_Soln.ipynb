In notation, vectors are denoted with lower case bold letters such as $\\mathbf{x}$.  The elements of a vector are all the same type. A vector does not, for example, contain both characters and numbers. The number of elements in the array is often referred to as the *dimension* though mathematicians may prefer *rank*. The vector shown has a dimension of $n$. The elements of a vector can be referenced with an index. In math settings, indexes typically run from 1 to n. In computer science and these labs, indexing will typically run from 0 to n-1.  In notation, elements of a vector, when referenced individually will indicate the index in a subscript, for example, the $0^{th}$ element, of the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ is $x_0$.
